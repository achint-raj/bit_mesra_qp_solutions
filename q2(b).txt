explain the differences between the source program, the object program, and an executable program.
 Which do you create, and which does the compiler create? Which does the linker or the loader create?


 Sol.
 The source program, object program, and executable program are different stages in the process of creating a computer program from source code. Let's explain each one:

Source Program:

The source program is the human-readable code written by a programmer using a high-level programming language like C, C++, Java, Python, etc.
It contains the source code instructions that convey the logic and functionality of the program.
Source code files typically have file extensions like ".c" for C language, ".cpp" for C++, ".java" for Java, and so on.
The source program is created by the programmer using a text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE).
Object Program:

The object program is the output generated by the compiler after it translates the source code into machine code or intermediate code (depending on the compilation process).
It is a binary representation of the source code that can be executed directly by the computer's processor.
The object program is not a complete, executable program yet; it contains machine code for individual functions or modules of the source program.
Object files typically have file extensions like ".o" for object files on Unix-based systems or ".obj" on Windows.
Executable Program:

The executable program is the final, complete, and runnable version of the software that can be executed directly by the operating system or the computer's processor.
It is generated from one or more object files by the linker, which resolves dependencies and merges them into a single executable file.
The executable program is the result of the entire compilation and linking process and can be run on the target machine without further processing.
Executable files typically have file extensions like ".exe" on Windows or no extension on Unix-based systems.
Now, let's discuss who creates each of these:

Source Program: The source program is created by the programmer who writes the code in a high-level programming language.
Object Program: The compiler creates the object program. It translates the source code into machine code or intermediate code and generates individual object files for each source code module.
Executable Program: The linker (or sometimes the loader) creates the executable program. The linker takes the object files generated by the compiler and links them together to create the final, complete, and executable program. The loader, on the other hand, loads the executable program into memory for execution, but this step is usually part of the operating system's job.
To summarize, the programmer creates the source program, the compiler creates the object program, and the linker (or sometimes the loader) creates the executable program.
