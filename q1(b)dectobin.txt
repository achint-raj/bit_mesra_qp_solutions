//C program to covert a decimal number to equivalent binary number using  bitwise operators

int d,sum=0,count=0,calcval=0;
		while(N>0){
		    d = N % 2;
		    N/=2;
		    calcval = (int)Math.pow(10,count)*d;
		    sum+=calcval;
		    count++;
		    
		}
		System.out.println(sum);


        //you can also solve this using array it will be very much easier than this one.
